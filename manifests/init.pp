# == Class: auditd
#
# Full description of class auditd here.
#
# === Parameters
#
# Document parameters here.
#
# [*package_name*]
#   The package name for auditd.
#
# [*manage_audit_files*]
#   If true then /etc/audit/rules.d/ will be managed by this module.
#   This means any rules not created using this module's defined type
#   will be removed.
#
# [*rules_file*]
#   The file that Audit rules should be added to.
#
# [*log_file*]
#   This keyword specifies the full path name to the log file where audit
#   records will be stored. It must be a regular file.
#
# [*log_format*]
#   The log format describes how the information should be stored on disk.
#   There are 3 options: 
#   * RAW, 
#	audit records will be stored in a format exactly as sent by kernel
#   * ENRICHED
#   	resolve all uid, gid, syscall, architecture, and socket addresses
#   * NOLOG
#   	deprecated in modern auditd versions (set write_logs option to no 
#   	instead)
#
# [*log_group*]
#   This keyword specifies the group that is applied to the log file's
#   permissions. The default is root. The group name can be either numeric
#   or spelled out.
#
# [*write_logs*]
#   This yes/no keyword determines whether or not to write logs to the disk.
#   There are two options: yes and no. It is meant to replace the usage of
#   log_format = NOLOG. This will default to undef since it is only available
#   in version >= 2.5.2.
#
# [*priority_boost*]
#   This is a non-negative number that tells the audit damon how much of
#   a priority boost it should take. The default is 3. No change is 0.
#
# [*flush*]
#   Valid values are none, incremental, incremental_async, data, and sync. If
#   set to none, no special effort is made to flush the audit records to
#   disk. If set to incremental, Then the freq parameter is used to determine
#   how often an explicit flush to disk is issued. The incremental_async
#   parameter is very much like incremental except the flushing is done
#   asynchronously for higher performance. The data parameter tells the audit
#   daemon to keep the data portion of the disk file sync'd at all times. The
#   sync option tells the audit daemon to keep both the data and meta-data
#   fully sync'd with every write to disk. The default value is
#   incremental_async.
#
# [*freq*]
#   This is a non-negative number that tells the audit damon how many records
#   to write before issuing an explicit flush to disk command. this value is
#   only valid when the flush keyword is set to incremental.
#
# [*num_logs*]
#   This keyword specifies the number of log files to keep if rotate is given
#   as the max_log_file_action. If the number is < 2, logs are not rotated.
#   This number must be 99 or less. The default is 0 - which means no
#   rotation. As you increase the number of log files being rotated, you may
#   need to adjust the kernel backlog setting upwards since it takes more time
#   to rotate the files.
#
# [*disp_qos*]
#   This option controls whether you want blocking/lossless or
#   non-blocking/lossy communication between the audit daemon and the
#   dispatcher. There is a 128k buffer between the audit daemon and
#   dispatcher. This is good enogh for most uses. If lossy is chosen, incoming
#   events going to the dispatcher are discarded when this queue is full.
#   (Events are still written to disk if log_format is not nolog.) Otherwise
#   the auditd daemon will wait for the queue to have an empty spot before
#   logging to disk. The risk is that while the daemon is waiting for network
#   IO, an event is not being recorded to disk. Valid values are: lossy and
#   lossless.
#
# [*dispatcher*]
#   The dispatcher is a program that is started by the audit daemon when it
#   starts up. It will pass a copy of all audit events to that application's
#   stdin. Make sure you trust the application that you add to this line since
#   it runs with root privileges.
#
# [*name_format*]
#   This option controls how computer node names are inserted into the audit
#   event stream. It has the following choices: none, hostname, fqd, numeric,
#   and user. None means that no computer name is inserted into the audit
#   event. hostname is the name returned by the gethostname syscall. The fqd
#   means that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a fully
#   qualified domain name of that machine. Numeric is similar to fqd except
#   it resolves the IP address of the machine. User is an admin defined string
#   from the name option.
#
# [*admin*]
#   This is the admin defined string that identifies the machine if user is
#   given as the name_format option.
#
# [*max_log_file*]
#   This keyword specifies the maximum file size in megabytes. When this limit
#   is reached, it will trigger a configurable action. The value given must
#   be numeric.
#
# [*max_log_file_action*]
#   This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
#   detected that the max file size limit has been reached. Valid values are
#   ignore, syslog, suspend, rotate and keep_logs. If set to ignore, the audit
#   daemon does nothing. syslog means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
#   suspend will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk.
#   The daemon will still be alive. The rotate option will cause the audit
#   daemon to rotate the logs. It should be noted that logs with higher
#   numbers are older than logs with lower numbers. This is the same convention
#   used by the logrotate utility. The keep_logs option is similar to rotate
#   except it does not use the num_logs setting. This prevents audit logs from
#   being overwritten.
#
# [*space_left*]
#   This is a numeric value in megabytes that tells the audit daemon when to
#   perform a configurable action because the system is starting to run low
#   on disk space.
#
# [*space_left_action*]
#   This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
#   detected that it is starting to get low on disk space. Valid values are
#   ignore, syslog, email, suspend, single, and halt. If set to ignore, the
#   audit daemon does nothing. syslog means that it will issue a warning to
#   syslog. Email means that it will send a warning to the email account
#   specified in action_mail_acct as well as sending the message to syslog.
#   suspend will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk.
#   The daemon will still be alive. The single option will cause the audit
#   daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. halt option will
#   cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.
#
# [*action_mail_acct*]
#   This option should contain a valid email address or alias. The default
#   address is root. If the email address is not local to the machine, you
#   must make sure you have email properly configured on your machine and
#   network. Also, this option requires that /usr/lib/sendmail exists on the
#   machine.
#
# [*admin_space_left*]
#   This is a numeric value in megabytes that tells the audit daemon when to
#   perform a configurable action because the system is running low on disk
#   space. This should be considered the last chance to do something before
#   running out of disk space. The numeric value for this parameter should be
#   lower than the number for space_left.
#
# [*admin_space_left_action*]
#   This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
#   detected that it is low on disk space. Valid values are ignore, syslog,
#   email, suspend, single, and halt. If set to ignore, the audit daemon does
#   nothing. Syslog means that it will issue a warning to syslog. Email means
#   that it will send a warning to the email account specified in
#   action_mail_acct as well as sending the message to syslog. Suspend will
#   cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will
#   still be alive. The single option will cause the audit daemon to put the
#   computer system in single user mode. halt option will cause the audit
#   daemon to shutdown the computer system.
#
# [*disk_full_action*]
#   This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
#   detected that the partition to which log files are written has become
#   full. Valid values are ignore, syslog, suspend, single, and halt. If set
#   to ignore, the audit daemon does nothing. Syslog means that it will issue
#   a warning to syslog. Suspend will cause the audit daemon to stop writing
#   records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The single option
#   will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user
#   mode. halt option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer
#   system.
#
# [*disk_error_action*]
#   This parameter tells the system what action to take whenever there is an
#   error detected when writing audit events to disk or rotating logs. Valid
#   values are ignore, syslog, suspend, single, and halt. If set to ignore,
#   the audit daemon does nothing. Syslog means that it will issue a warning
#   to syslog. Suspend will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to
#   the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The single option will cause the
#   audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. halt option
#   will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.
#
# [*tcp_listen_port*]
#   This is a numeric value in the range 1..65535 which, if specified, causes
#   auditd to listen on the corresponding TCP port for audit records from
#   remote systems. The audit daemon may be linked with tcp_wrappers. You may
#   want to controll access with an entry in the hosts.allow and deny files.
#
# [*tcp_listen_queue*]
#   This is a numeric value which indicates how many pending (requested but
#   unaccepted) connections are allowed. The default is 5. Setting this too
#   small may cause connections to be rejected if too many hosts start up at
#   exactly the same time, such as after a power failure.
#
# [*tcp_max_per_addr*]
#   This is a numeric value which indicates how many concurrent connections
#   from one IP address is allowed. The default is 1 and the maximum is 16.
#   Setting this too large may allow for a Denial of Service attack on the
#   logging server. The default should be adequate in most cases unless a
#   custom written recovery script runs to forward unsent events. In this
#   case you would increase the number only large enough to let it in too.
#
# [*tcp_client_ports*]
#   This parameter may be a single numeric value or two values separated by a
#   dash (no spaces allowed). It indicates which client ports are allowed for
#   incoming connections. If not specified, any port is allowed. Allowed
#   values are 1..65535. For example, to require the client use a privileged
#   port, specify 1-1023 for this parameter. You will also need to set the
#   local_port option in the audisp-remote.conf file. Making sure that clients
#   send from a privileged port is a security feature to prevent log injection
#   attacks by untrusted users.
#
# [*tcp_client_max_idle*]
#   This parameter indicates the number of seconds that a client may be idle
#   (i.e. no data from them at all) before auditd complains. This is used to
#   close inactive connections if the client machine has a problem where it
#   cannot shutdown the connection cleanly. Note that this is a global setting,
#   and must be higher than any individual client heartbeat_timeout setting,
#   preferably by a factor of two. The default is zero, which disables this
#   check.
#
# [*enable_krb5*]
#   If set to "yes", Kerberos 5 will be used for authentication and encryption.
#
# [*krb5_principal*]
#   This is the principal for this server. The default is "auditd". Given this
#   default, the server will look for a key named like
#   auditd/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM stored in /etc/audit/audit.key to authenticate
#   itself, where hostname is the canonical name for the server's host, as
#   returned by a DNS lookup of its IP address.
#
# [*krb5_key_file*]
#   Location of the key for this client's principal. Note that the key file
#   must be owned by root and mode 0400.
#
# [*rules_file*]
#   Location of the Audit rules file.
#
# [*manage_audit_files*]
#   On systems with 'rules.d' directory whether or not to manage that directory
#   removing rules not managed by Puppet.
#
# [*buffer_size*]
#   Sets the buffer size used by Auditd.
#
# [*audisp_q_depth*]
#   This is a numeric value that tells how big to make the internal queue of
#   the audit event dispatcher. A bigger queue lets it handle a flood of
#   events better, but could hold events that are not processed when the daemon
#   is terminated. If you get messages in syslog about events getting dropped,
#   increase this value.
#
# [*audisp_overflow_action*]
#   This option determines how the daemon should react to overflowing its
#   internal queue. When this happens, it means that more events are being
#   received than it can get rid of. This error means that it is going to lose
#   the current event its trying to dispatch. It has the following choices:
#   ignore, syslog, suspend, single, and halt. If set to ignore, the audisp
#   daemon does nothing. syslog means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
#   suspend will cause the audisp daemon to stop processing events. The daemon
#   will still be alive. The single option will cause the audisp daemon to put
#   the computer system in single user mode. halt option will cause the audisp
#   daemon to shutdown the computer system.
#
# [*audisp_priority_boost*]
#   This is a non-negative number that tells the audit event dispatcher how
#   much of a priority boost it should take. This boost is in addition to the
#   boost provided from the audit daemon. The default is 4. No change is 0.
#
# [*audisp_max_restarts*]
#   This is a non-negative number that tells the audit event dispatcher how
#   many times it can try to restart a crashed plugin.
#
# [*audisp_max_restarts*]
#   This option controls how computer node names are inserted into the audit
#   event stream. It has the following choices: none, hostname, fqd, numeric,
#   and user. None means that no computer name is inserted into the audit
#   event. hostname is the name returned by the gethostname syscall. The fqd
#   means that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a fully
#   qualified domain name of that machine. Numeric is similar to fqd except it
#   resolves the IP address of the machine. User is an admin defined string
#   from the name option.
#
# [*audisp_name*]
#   This is the admin defined string that identifies the machine if user is
#   given as the name_format option.
#
# [*manage_service*]
#   Whether or not the auditd service should be managed. This should only
#   be set to false if you use another module to manage auditd service
#   such as an selinux module.
#
# [*service_restart*]
#   Command to restart the auditd service.
#
# [*service_stop*]
#   Command to stop the auditd service.
#
# [*service_ensure*]
#   The status the auditd daemon should be in.
#
# [*service_enable*]
#   Whether or not to start the auditd service on boot.
#
# [*rules*]
#   Hash of auditd rules to be applied using the audit::rule defined type.
